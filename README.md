# PCA

1. Eigen vector
2. Eigen values

Eigen vector that used to find the direction

Eigen value that is a number, telling you how variance there in a direction

1. The Eigen vector with the highest eigan value is the principle component
2. standardize the data
3. calculate the co-variance between the datas
4. Deduce the eigens
5. Re-orient and plot the datas


Code-

1. Load cancer dataset
2. standardize the data
3. Fit PCA with the number of Features
4. Transform the PCA model
5. polt the points 
6. Find the variance

Basically, PCA is the dimensinal reduction techinque that used with the help of eigen vector and eigen values to reduce the feature and transfrom it.
